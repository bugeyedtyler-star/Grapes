                <h3>Verifying two Virtual Machines Connection</h3>
                <div class="job-meta">Virtualkization, Kali Linux | CIAT</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>The first step in setting up the lab environment is installing the DEVASC-LAB virtual machine on VirtualBox. To begin, the DEVASC-LAB image must be downloaded from Cisco's official resources. Once the download is complete, VirtualBox is used to import the appliance. This is done by selecting the "Import Appliance" option and choosing the .ova file for the DEVASC-LAB. During the import process, it is important to review and adjust settings such as the amount of memory and number of CPUs allocated to the VM to ensure optimal performance. After the appliance has been successfully imported, the VM can be started to verify that it boots correctly and is ready for use.</li>
                    <li>Following the installation of the DEVASC-LAB VM, the next task is to install the CSR1000v virtual machine. Unlike the DEVASC-LAB, the CSR1000v often requires a more manual setup process. After downloading the CSR1000v image from Cisco, a new virtual machine must be created in VirtualBox. During the creation process, the operating system type should be set to "Linux" and the version should be selected as "Other Linux (64-bit)." Adequate system resources must be allocated, typically including at least 4 GB of RAM and multiple CPU cores. The downloaded CSR1000v disk image, whether ISO or VHD format, must then be attached to the new VM's storage settings. Once configured, the VM can be started, and any required initial setup steps for the CSR1000v router can be completed</li>
                    <li>After both virtual machines have been installed and started, it is necessary to verify communication between them. To accomplish this, both VMs must be connected to the same VirtualBox network, such as an internal network or a host-only adapter. Once network settings are properly configured, the DEVASC-LAB VM can be used to initiate a ping to the IP address of the CSR1000v VM. Receiving successful ping replies confirms that the two machines can communicate effectively, completing the basic setup process.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>I Logged into the Virtual Machine, Opened the Terminal to modify GRUB Settings: Edit the /etc/default/grub file using sudo vi /etc/default/grub. Changed the GRUB_TIMEOUT=5 to GRUB_TIMEOUT=30. Updated the GRUB Configuration by running sudo grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg to apply changes. Reboot the System, Reboot with sudo reboot. If the GRUB menu doesn't appear, hold the left shift key during boot. Enter Single User Mode When GRUB menu appears, press e to edit. Add single after the word "quiet" in the "linux" line. Press Ctrl-x to boot into single-user mode. Verify Root Access: Enter the root password when prompted. Confirm root login with id and check the run level with runlevel. Continue Booting: Press Ctrl-d to continue booting normally.</li>

                <div class="job-meta">Python, BeautifulSoup, Requests | Personal Project</div>
                <ul>
                    <li>I created a Kali Linux live boot with persistence using Rufus to set up a portable and customizable penetration testing environment. This involved using Rufus to create a bootable USB drive with Kali Linux, configuring a persistent storage partition to retain data across reboots, and ensuring proper bootloader settings for persistence. The process also included partitioning the drive, editing configuration files, and testing the setup to verify that changes, such as installed tools or files, would persist after restarting. The project combined skills in Linux system administration, partition management, and cybersecurity best practices.</li>
